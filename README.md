# 📝 Swiftask

Swiftask is a lightweight, modular task management application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, organized using Webpack. This project is part of the Odin Project curriculum and focuses on building efficient, dynamic interfaces while applying modular code practices.

While to-do lists are common projects, creating this app from scratch provided invaluable experience with JavaScript structuring, event handling, local storage, and UI/UX design. It’s simple—but purposeful.

## ✨Features
- ➕ Add New Tasks — Quickly add tasks with a title, due date, and priority level.
