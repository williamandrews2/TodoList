# Todo List

## Introduction

If you are reading this, hello! Yes, this is another todo list. While some people may see this as another one of many, it has still brought value to me in the sense that I have learned quite a bit working on this project. Maybe these are popular for a good reason...

## Known issues and todos (haha)

- Ability to edit pre-existing tasks.
- Ability to sort todos by the date or priority.
- Move completed todos to the bottom.
